# 🐮 CattleBots 🐮

Cattlebots is a turn-based command line game. You battle it out with the enemy cow, and you can configure settings to spice up the gameplay!

## ❓ How To Play

#### 🚀 Installation

You can install the exe directly by checking the latest release, or you can build the C file yourself.

#### 🕹 The Game

All menus in the game depend on the first character. For example, both "settings" and "splay" would make you go to the settings menu. Casing does not matter on all inputs.

When choosing your move, you can either type the move (only the first character matters though) or a number. For example, move "1" would be attack.

## ⚙ Settings

#### 🤖 Robot Strategy

Choose from 12 different strategies for your opponent. These strategies change the way your opponent acts.

#### 🐄 Cow Type

Choose a cow type for both you and your opponent. Cow types affect the probabilities of certain moves.
